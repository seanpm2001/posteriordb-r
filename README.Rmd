# `posteriordb-r`: an R package to work with `posteriordb`

This repository contain the R package to easily work with the [posteriordb](https://github.com/stan-dev/posteriordb) repository. The R package included database contain convenience functions to access data, model code and information for individual posteriors, models, data and draws.


## Installation

To install the package
To install only the R package and then access the posteriors remotely, just install the package from GitHub using the `remotes` package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("stan-dev/posteriordb-r")
```

To load the package, just run.

```{r}
library(posteriordb)
```

## Connect to the posterior database

First we create the posterior database to use, here we can use the database locally (if the `posteriordb` repo is cloned).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_pdb <- pdb_local()
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Store the PDB_PATH in .env
dotenv::load_dot_env()
my_pdb <- pdb_local(Sys.getenv("PDB_PATH"))
```

The above code requires that your working directory is in the main folder of the cloned repository. Otherwise we can use the `path` argument.

We can also simply use the github repository directly to access the data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_pdb <- pdb_github()
```

Independent of the posterior database used, the following works for all.

## Access content

To list the posteriors available in the database, use `posterior_names()`.

```{r}
pos <- posterior_names(my_pdb)
head(pos)
```

In the same fashion, we can list data and models included in the database as

```{r}
mn <- model_names(my_pdb)
head(mn)

dn <- data_names(my_pdb)
head(dn)
```

We can also get all information on each individual posterior as a tibble with

```{r}
pos <- posteriors_tbl_df(my_pdb)
head(pos)
```

The posterior's name is made up of the data and model fitted
to the data. Together, these two uniquely define a posterior distribution.
To access a posterior object we can use the model name.

```{r}
po <- posterior("eight_schools-eight_schools_centered", my_pdb)
```

From the posterior object, we can access data, model code (i.e., Stan code
in this case) and a lot of other useful information.

```{r}
dat <- pdb_data(po)
dat

code <- stan_code(po)
code
```

We can also access the paths to data after they have been unzipped and copied to the cache directory set in `pdb` (the R temp directory by default).

```{r}
dfp <- data_file_path(po)
dfp

scfp <- stan_code_file_path(po)
scfp
```

We can also access information regarding the model and the data used to compute the posterior.

```{r}
data_info(po)
model_info(po)
```

Note that the references are referencing to BibTeX items that can be found in `content/references/references.bib`.

We can access most of the posterior information as a `tbl_df` using

```{r}
tbl <- posteriors_tbl_df(my_pdb)
head(tbl)
```

In addition, we can also access a list of posteriors with `filter_posteriors()`. The filtering function follows dplyr filter semantics based on the posterior tibble.

```{r}
pos <- filter_posteriors(pdb = my_pdb, data_name == "eight_schools")
pos
```

To access reference posterior draws we use `reference_posterior_draws()`.

```{r}
rpd <- reference_posterior_draws(po)
```

The function `reference_posterior_draws()` returns a posterior `draws_list` object that can be summarized and transformed using the `posterior` package.

```{r}
posterior::summarize_draws(rpd)
```

To access information on the reference posterior we can use `reference_posterior_draws_info()` or just use `info()` on the reference posterior. This give soime basic information on how the reference posterior was computed.

```{r}
rpi <- reference_posterior_draws_info(po)
rpi

info(rpd)
```
